### Challenges:  

This week was the most challenging for me with regards to time management.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to dedicate too much time on my activities and homework, I had to work overtime to get caught up at work, while still adjusting to be confine to my room living, working, and doing school work has proven to be challenging in my ability to get motivated and concentrate on schoolwork. 

This has been a lesson, I plan to complete my assignment by mid next week and make immediate changes to my daily schedule to help me compartmentalize work and school and home living. :-)

I have to complete the followign bugs/tasks: accurately show score results, links score to results html page, and add JS code to results html to show high scores.
